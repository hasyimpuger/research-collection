# Grouping of Waste Banks Using the K-Medoid Method
The waste bank is a program launched by the Yogyakarta city government to tackle the growing waste pile. The waste bank has the concept of collecting dry and sorted waste and has management like banks, but what is saved is not money but garbage. At present there is no identification of the condition of the garbage bank that is still running. The solution to identifying each waste bank is by grouping each waste bank based on its management, so as to facilitate the government to know the condition of each waste bank.

This study aims to classify waste bank data with the same characteristics into the same cluster and data with different characteristics to other clusters using the K-Medoids Method. The steps are carried out, namely loading datasets, clening data, calculating distances with Euclidean Distance, then entering the K-Medoids clustering stage, and evaluating patterns with Shilhoutte Coefficient.

Of the 227 data obtained, 2 groups were formed. The group formed based on the test results using Shilhoutte Coeficient is 0.104. Where group 1 belongs to a group that has criteria both in all aspects of assessment, namely building construction, management system, work mechanism, and implementation. Group 2 is included as a poor criterion in terms of implementation which is of very high value, so that the waste bank group needs to be increased in group 2.
