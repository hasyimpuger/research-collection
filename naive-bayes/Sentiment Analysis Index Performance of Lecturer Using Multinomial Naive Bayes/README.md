# Sentiment Analysis Index Performance of Lecturer Using Multinomial Naive Bayes
Informatics Engineering Program (TIF) is one of the existing courses at Ahmad Dahlan University
(UAD) Yogyakarta. At the end of each semester the Academic Administration Department conducts an
evaluation of learning services using questionnaire instruments with the answers provided along with
comments or suggestions from the students. However, so far the faculty and the study program have not
utilized the comments or suggestions from the students on the teaching method of lecturers as an evaluation

This research developed a system of sentiment analysis on lecturer performance index with Na誰ve

labeling the train data, preprocessing text on the data, and the process of classification with Na誰ve Bayes.
So it can provide information that is very useful to know teaching methods lecturers. The application of
Na誰ve Bayes method to the lecturer performance index sentiment analysis used to analyze student sentiment
level has optimal time performance with good classification accuracy.

The results of this study using data questionnaire as many as 13508 data that has 3 class sentiment
is positive, neutral and negative. Accuracy resulted from this research using 10 K-Fold Cross Validation
method that is 0,97 with 13000 data and classifier quality using Kappa Statistic has Kappa value 0,88. So
in the range of quality classifier have interpretation near prefect performance.
