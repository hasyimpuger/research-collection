# Grouping Trend Research Title Using K-Means Clustering

One of the requirements for graduating students in Higher Education is completing a final assignment or
thesis, not least in Ahmad Dahlan University (UAD) Industrial Engineering Study Program (IT). Thesis is
scientific works that must be written by students which contain research topics, backgrounds
problems, theories, research methods and results, so that with this, the thesis can be grouped
based on areas of interest that can produce thesis topic trends. Knowledge of thesis topic trends
students in a university in general and in certain study programs in particular can
bring very positive benefits for curriculum development. The obstacle faced by the thesis coordinator
IT Study Program in producing the topic topic of the thesis title is the absence of a program or website
can accommodate the thesis title to be grouped so that there has never been a grouping
towards the thesis title. This causes the IT Study Program to have no record data
show the topic trend of the thesis title. Based on these problems, this study intends to make it
program to classify thesis titles so that knowledge is obtained about the topic trends of the thesis title
which can benefit the IT and student study program thesis coordinators.

The method used in this study is K-Means clustering while the measurement method
distance used is cosine similarity. Before entering the text mining stage, a process is carried out
design including database design and interface design. Database design
used to determine data that will enter into the database (database) and support various
system design. Interface design includes menu structure design and display design on
user display. The stages of text mining are tokenizing, filtering, stemming, similarity, grouping,
testing.

The results of this study are programs that can process title data into topic trend group patterns
thesis title. Of the 138 data obtained, 3 groups were formed according to the fields of study in the IT Study Program.
From the results of the Silhouette Coefficient test showed results of 0.5674 with range cluster = 3 which means
Silhouette Coefficient value produces a group that is classified as low. This is caused by text data
the title of the thesis is too diffuse, so that between the titles of one with the other titles have similarities
The low one.
